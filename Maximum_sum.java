	 * Swap and Maximize Given an array a[ ] of N elements. Consider array as a
	 * circular array i.e. element after an is a1. The task is to find maximum sum
	 * of the absolute difference between consecutive elements with rearrangement of
	 * array elements allowed i.e. after any rearrangement of array elements find
	 * |a1 – a2| + |a2 – a3| + …… + |an-1 – an| + |an – a1|.
	 * 
	 * Example 1:
	 * 
	 * Input: N = 4 a[] = {4, 2, 1, 8} Output: 18 Explanation: Rearrangement done is
	 * {1, 8, 2, 4}. Sum of absolute difference between consecutive elements after
	 * rearrangement = |1 - 8| + |8 - 2| + |2 - 4| + |4 - 1| = 7 + 6 + 2 + 3 = 18.
